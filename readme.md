## Abstract

> The original paper is a national scale study of the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and disability characteristics (by demographic) in the United States. The paper aims to determine whether COVID-19 incidence is more significant in counties with larger proportions of socio-demographically disadvantaged people with disabilities, based on race, ethnicity, poverty status, and biological sex.

This study is a replication of:

## Study Metadata

-   `Key words`: Comma-separated list of keywords (tags) for searchability. Geographers often use one or two keywords each for: theory, geographic context, and methods.
-   `Subject`: select from the [BePress Taxonomy](http://digitalcommons.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&context=reference)
-   `Date created`: date when project was started
-   `Date modified`: date of most recent revision
-   `Spatial Coverage`: Specify the geographic extent of your study. This may be a place name and link to a feature in a gazetteer like GeoNames or OpenStreetMap, or a well known text (WKT) representation of a bounding box.
-   `Spatial Resolution`: Specify the spatial resolution as a scale factor, description of the level of detail of each unit of observation (including administrative level of administrative areas), and/or or distance of a raster GRID size
-   `Spatial Reference System`: Specify the geographic or projected coordinate system for the study
-   `Temporal Coverage`: Specify the temporal extent of your study---i.e. the range of time represented by the data observations.
-   `Temporal Resolution`: Specify the temporal resolution of your study---i.e. the duration of time for which each observation represents or the revisit period for repeated observations

## Compendium structure and contents

This research compendium is structured with four main directories:

-   `data`: contains subdirectories for `raw` data and `derived` data.
-   `docs`: contains subdirectories for `manuscript`, `presentation`, and `report`
-   `procedure`: contains subdirectories for `code` or software scripts, information about the computational `environment` in which the research was conducted, and non-code research `protocols`
-   `results`: contains subdirectories for `figures`, formatted data `tables`, or `other` formats of research results.

The data, procedures, and results of this repository are outlined in three tables:

-   Data: [data/data_index.csv](data/data_index.csv)
-   Procedures: [procedure/procedure_index.csv](procedure/procedure_index.csv)
-   Results: [results/results_index.csv](results/results_index.csv)

Important local **documents** include:

-   Pre-analysis plan: [docs/report/preanalysis.pdf](https://padutchfan123.github.io/RPr-Chakraborty-2021/docs/preanalysis_plan.html)
-   Study report: [docs/report/report.pdf](https://padutchfan123.github.io/RPr-Chakraborty-2021/docs/report.html)
-   Manuscript: [docs/manuscript/manuscript.pdf](docs/manuscript/manuscript.pdf)
